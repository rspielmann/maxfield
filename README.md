# Introduction

This is for Ingress. If you don't know what that is, you're lost.

This code is designed to make a plan for linking a given set of portals in the
way (and the order) that creates the most fields. This is harder than it sounds.
If you're working on more than a dozen portals, learning to use this code may
be faster than planning by hand.

This code follows the procedure in my [YouTube video][0].


# Prerequisites

You'll need [Python][2] (I've got 2.7) as well as networkx, numpy, and matplotlib.

You can get these setup easily with the [Enthought Python Distribution][1].

You can use [pip][3] to install the dependencies via:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example

I'll be distributing this code with a file EXAMPLE.csv. Try running

    python makePlan.py -n 4 EXAMPLE.csv out/ output.pkl

where "out/" must already exist. This will put a bunch of files into the "out/" directory (see OUTPUT FILE LIST).

Now try running

    python makePlan.py -n 3 out/output.pkl

This uses the plan stored in output.pkl instead of calculating a new one. It will create files for 3 agents instead of 4.

### OUTPUT FILE LIST

	keyPrep.txt
		List of portals, their numbers on the map, and how many keys are needed

	keys_for_agent_M_of_N.txt
		List of keys agent number M will need (if N agents are participating)

	links_for_agent_M_of_N.txt
		List of ALL the links
		Total distance traveled and AP earned by agent number M
			* Except for the links marked with a star (*), the links should be made IN THE ORDER LISTED
			* Links with a star can be made out of order, but only EARLY i.e. BEFORE their position in the list (this can save you time)
			* The links that agent number M makes are marked with underscores__
			* The first portal listed is the origin portal (where the agent must be)
			* The second portal listed is the destination portal (for which the agent must have a key)

	portalMap.png
		A map showing the locations of the portals
	linkMap.png
		A map showing the locations of portals and links
			* Up is north
			* Portal numbers increase from north to south
			* Portal numbers match "keyPrep.txt" and "linkes_for_agent_M_of_N.txt"
			* Link numbers match those in the link schedules "links_for_agent_M_of_N.txt"

	ownershipPrep.txt
		List of portals whose first link is incoming
			* These portals need to be captured and fully powered before the linking operation
		List of portals whose first link is outgoing
			* You may be able to save time by capturing and fully powering these portals DURING the linking operation

	lastPlan.pkl
		A Python pickle file containing all portal and plan information
			* The default name is "lastPlan.pkl"
			* In the examples above, this is called "output.pkl"

# Warranty

No promises

# Usage

    python makePlan.py [-b] -n agent_count input_file [output_directory] [output_file]

    -b:          Include this option if you like your maps blue instead of green for any reason

    -n agent_count: Number of agents for which to make a plan

    input_file:  One of two types of files:
        .csv   format:
            portal name , latE6 , lngE6 [,keys]

            portal name should not contain commas
            latE6 and lngE6 should be the portal's global coordinates
            E6 means times 10^6 (no decimal)
                e.g. the Big Ben portal is at 51500775,-124466
            keys (optional parameter) is the number of keys you have for the portal
            If you leave this blank, the program assumes you have no keys

        .pkl   an output from a previous run of this program
            this can be used to make the same plan with a different number of agents

    output_directory: directory in which to put all output
        default is the working directory

    output_file: name for a .pkl file containing information on the plan
        if you later use this for the input file, the same plan will be
        produced with the number of agents you specify (default: "lastPlan.pkl")

# Notes

The space of possible max-field plans is large. Rather than trying every
possibility, this program randomly tries some plans and presents you with one
that doesn't require you to obtain too many more keys.

If you don't like the plan you got, run it again. You'll probably get a
different plan.
